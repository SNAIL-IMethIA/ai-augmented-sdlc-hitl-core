# Create strategy from scratch

**ID:** REQ-05

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall allow a user to construct a new strategy from scratch by assembling building blocks without any pre-existing template.

**Rationale:**
Users with unique strategy ideas must not be constrained to pre-defined structures; a blank-canvas mode enables full creative control.

**Fit Criterion:**

- A user can create a complete, runnable strategy by selecting and connecting blocks from a component library.
- No template or pre-existing configuration is required to initiate blank strategy creation.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 5: Foundational capability; the product's core value proposition depends on it.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 5: Without this, users cannot build custom strategies at all.
