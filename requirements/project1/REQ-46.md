# In-app onboarding tutorials

**ID:** REQ-46

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall provide interactive onboarding tutorials within the application UI that guide new users through the primary workflows.

**Rationale:**
In-app tutorials reduce dependency on external documentation and increase the likelihood that new users successfully complete their first strategy without abandonment.

**Fit Criterion:**

- At least one interactive tutorial covers each of the following workflows: strategy creation, backtesting, and result interpretation.
- Tutorials are accessible from within the application at any time, not only on first launch.
- Each tutorial step highlights the relevant UI element and provides a clear instruction.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 3: Directly improves new user activation and reduces support burden.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 1: New users must rely on external documentation or trial-and-error, increasing drop-off risk.
