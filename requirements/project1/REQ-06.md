# Select strategy from presets

**ID:** REQ-06

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall allow a user to select and load a strategy from a library of pre-defined presets.

**Rationale:**
Presets lower the barrier to entry for new users and provide validated starting points that can be adapted rather than built from scratch.

**Fit Criterion:**

- At least one preset is available for selection at any time.
- Loading a preset fully populates the builder with its configuration within 3 seconds.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 4: Significantly reduces onboarding friction for new users.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 2: Users can still build from scratch, but the learning curve is higher without presets.

**Dependencies / Conflicts:**
REQ-05, REQ-09, REQ-52

**Status:**
