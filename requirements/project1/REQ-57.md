# Visual aids in documentation

**ID:** REQ-57

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall include visual aids (annotated diagrams, illustrations, and short animations) within the onboarding flow and documentation to explain strategy concepts, pipeline structure, and indicator behaviour.

**Rationale:**
Visual aids lower the learning curve for non-expert users by conveying structural and relational concepts that are difficult to communicate through text alone.

**Fit Criterion:**

- At least one visual aid (diagram or animation) is present for each major concept covered in the onboarding tutorials (pipeline structure, indicator types, risk settings, backtesting).
- Visual aids are embedded inline with related text and accessible without navigating away from the current context.
- Animations can be paused and replayed by the user.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 3: Enhances comprehension but users can learn from text alone.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 0: Absence increases learning time but does not block usage.

**Dependencies / Conflicts:**
REQ-46, REQ-47, REQ-48
