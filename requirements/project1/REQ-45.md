# Advanced mode sandbox

**ID:** REQ-45

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall provide an Advanced mode that offers an unconstrained sandbox environment with full access to all tools, custom component import, custom exchange and asset configuration, and free-form pipeline construction without an enforced workflow.

**Rationale:**
Expert users require unrestricted access to the full feature set and the freedom to construct strategies in any order, including non-standard configurations not supported by the guided Basic mode.

**Fit Criterion:**

- In Advanced mode, a user can create and execute a strategy without following any prescribed workflow steps.
- All customisation features (custom exchange, custom asset, custom component import, free-form pipeline) are accessible and functional exclusively in Advanced mode.
- No Advanced mode feature is accessible from Basic mode.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 4: Essential for power users who would find Basic mode overly restrictive.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 4: Expert users are forced to work within the guided workflow, limiting expressiveness.

**Dependencies / Conflicts:**
