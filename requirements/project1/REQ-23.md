# Alignment grid with snap-to-grid

**ID:** REQ-23

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall provide an optional alignment grid in the pipeline canvas with snap-to-grid behaviour, each independently togglable by the user.

**Rationale:**
A grid with optional snapping helps users create well-organised, readable pipeline layouts without imposing rigidity on those who prefer free-form placement.

**Fit Criterion:**

- The grid can be shown and hidden independently of the snap setting.
- Snap-to-grid can be enabled and disabled independently of grid visibility.
- When snap is active, block placement aligns to the nearest grid node.
- Both settings persist across sessions.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 2: Useful for polish and readability, but not functionally critical.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 1: Absence is a minor inconvenience; free placement still works.
