# Configurable keyboard shortcuts

**ID:** REQ-27

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall provide a set of default keyboard shortcuts for common builder actions, and shall allow users to remap each shortcut to a custom key combination.

**Rationale:**
Keyboard shortcuts increase expert-user efficiency; configurability prevents conflicts with OS or accessibility key bindings.

**Fit Criterion:**

- At least 10 default shortcuts are defined and functional on first launch.
- Each shortcut can be remapped without conflict via a settings interface.
- Custom key mappings persist across application sessions.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 3: Power users benefit significantly; improves editing speed.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 1: Users can rely on pointer input; absence of shortcuts is a minor inconvenience.
