# Import custom components (Advanced mode)

**ID:** REQ-40

**Type:** Functional

**Originator:** Stakeholder / Client Interview

**Description:**
The system shall allow users in Advanced mode to import custom indicators, patterns, rules, and action blocks, and to extend the behaviour of existing built-in components.

**Rationale:**
Users with specialised strategies or proprietary indicators must not be restricted to the built-in block library; extensibility ensures the platform can serve expert and institutional users.

**Fit Criterion:**

- An imported custom component appears in the block selection panel within the correct category.
- The custom component functions correctly within a strategy pipeline (produces output, connects to compatible blocks).
- An extension to a built-in component overrides the target behaviour without disrupting unmodified components.

**Customer Satisfaction (0–5):**

- 3: Essential for power users and differentiates the tool from closed-ecosystem competitors.

**Customer Dissatisfaction (0–5):**

- 1: Expert users with proprietary logic are forced to adapt to built-in components only.
