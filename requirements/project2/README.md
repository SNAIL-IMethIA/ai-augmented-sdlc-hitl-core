# Requirements Register: Project 2

This folder contains the stakeholder requirements for **Project 2: Hotel (resort) reservation website**, extracted and formalised from client interviews and notes.

Phase 1 (Stakeholder Requirements Definition) was conducted prior to and independently of the timed evaluation. It is excluded from the 24-hour worktime measurement (3 standard work days of 8 hours each) applied to Phases 2–8.

Each requirement is documented in its own file following the Volere-inspired template defined in [`protocol/requirements.md`](../../protocol/requirements.md). This README serves as the central register and entry point for all requirements in this project.
